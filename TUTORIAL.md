## Getting Started

You can easily get started with play-clj by creating a new project with [Nightcode](https://nightcode.info/) and choosing the Clojure game option. You may also create a project on the command line with [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen):

    lein new play-clj hello-world

Either way, you'll get three separate projects for desktop, Android, and iOS, all pointing to the same directories for source code and resources. You can build the projects using Nightcode or Leiningen.

## Project Structure

After making a game called _hello-world_, you'll see three sub-folders: `android`, `desktop`, and `ios`. You'll be spending most of your time in the `desktop` folder, because it's easier to develop your game on your computer and build it for mobile devices later.

Your actual game code will be in the `desktop/src-common` folder, and all the images and sound files will be in the `desktop/resources` folder. When you're ready to build an Android and iOS version, they will read from both of these folders, so you don't have to duplicate any files.

## Your First Run

This tutorial will assume that you are using Nightcode, but it should be easy to follow without it as well. To kick things off, navigate to the main file at `desktop/src-common/hello_world/core.clj` by double-clicking each folder in the sidebar on the left. Once you click on `core.clj`, you should see its contents appear in the editor pane on the right.

As long as the selection in the sidebar is somewhere inside the `desktop` folder, the build pane at the bottom will apply to that version of your game. So, try clicking _Run_ and wait for your game to appear. If all goes well, you should see a window with nothing but a small label on the bottom left that says "Hello world!".

## Game Structure

Let's look at the basic structure of your game. It starts out with a call to `defgame`, which should only be used once as it initializes the game for you. It contains a single function called `:on-create` that runs when your game starts. The only thing it needs to do is hand off to your screen, where all the action takes place.

In `defscreen`, you'll find that a few simple functions are defined: `:on-show` and `:on-render`. The first only runs when the screen is first shown, and the second is run every single time your game wants to draw on the screen (which is ideally 60 times per second).

There are many other functions you can put inside `defscreen`, each letting you run code when certain important events happen. For now, we'll stick to the two we started with, because they are the most fundamental, but you can read [the documentation](http://oakes.github.io/play-clj/core.defscreen.html) to learn about the others.

## Entity System

Most games need some way to keep track of all the things displayed within them. We call these things "entities". Normally, we need to remember attributes such as their position, size, and possibly other values like health and damage. In play-clj, these entities are simply maps, so you can store whatever you want inside of them.

Often, games will store these entities in a list, and in their render function they will loop over the list, modify the entities (such as moving them), and then call a function to render them. With functional programming, on the other hand, we want to avoid directly mutating values, as it leads to more complicated and error-prone software.

Instead, play-clj stores the entities vector behind the scenes and passes it to each function within `defscreen`. It's a normal Clojure vector, so you can't directly change it. Instead, you must return a new entities vector at the end of each `defscreen` function, which will then be provided to all other functions when they run.

## Loading a Texture

Right now, you're using the `play-clj.ui` library to display a label. This library is useful for typical UI needs such as a title screen, but not very useful for the game itself. Let's get rid of it for now, and instead use the `play-clj.g2d` library, which contains the basic functions for 2D games. Try changing the `ns` declaration to look like this:

```clojure
(ns hello-world.core
  (:require [play-clj.core :refer :all]
            [play-clj.g2d :refer :all]))
```

Now let's find an image to use as a texture in the game. Find one you'd like to use, such as [this Clojure logo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Clojure_Programming_Language_Logo_Icon_SVG.svg/200px-Clojure_Programming_Language_Logo_Icon_SVG.svg.png), and save it to the `desktop/resources` folder. Next, simply change the line where the label entity is being created, so it creates a texture from that file instead:

```clojure
    (texture "clojure.png")
```

## Size and Position

If you run the code now, you'll see the image in the bottom-left corner. As mentioned, entities such as the one created by `texture` are simply Clojure records. By default, our entity will look like this:

```clojure
#play_clj.entities.TextureEntity{:object #<TextureRegion com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureRegion@4634b96>}
```

A `texture` contains the underlying Java object. By default, it will be drawn at the bottom-left corner with the size of the image itself. You can change the position and size by simply using `assoc`:

```clojure
    (assoc (texture "clojure.png")
           :x 50 :y 50 :width 100 :height 100)
```

You can also set scaling and rotation on a texture using :scale-x, :scale-y, and :angle, which all use (:origin-x, :origin-y) as the center. For example, here we rotate it 45 degrees counter-clockwise around the bottom-left corner:

```clojure
    (assoc (texture "clojure.png")
           :x 50 :y 50 :width 100 :height 100
           :angle 45 :origin-x 0 :origin-y 0)
```

## Input

Let's add a new function at the end of `defscreen` called `:on-key-down`, which runs when a key is pressed:

```clojure
  :on-key-down
  (fn [screen entities]
    )
```

If takes the same form as the other functions, expecting a new entities vector to be returned at the end. The first argument, `screen`, which we haven't talked about yet, is a Clojure map containing various important values. In the `:on-key-down` function, it will contain a `:key` which indicates what key was pressed.

To figure out what key it refers to, you'll need to compare it to a known key code, which you can get with `key-code`. See [the documentation](http://oakes.github.io/play-clj/core.key-code.html) or the example below to learn how to use it.

Let's write a conditional statement that prints out which arrow key you pressed. Note that if a `defscreen` function returns `nil`, it leaves the entities vector unchanged, so the code below won't wipe out the entities vector.

```clojure
  :on-key-down
  (fn [screen entities]
    (cond
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-down))
      (println "down")
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-up))
      (println "up")
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-right))
      (println "right")
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-left))
      (println "left")))
```

Now, what about mobile devices? We may not have a keyboard, so let's create an `:on-touch-down` function:

```clojure
  :on-touch-down
  (fn [screen entities]
    )
```

In this case, the screen map will contain an `:input-x` and `:input-y` for the point on the screen that was touched. We can simply check to see what part of the screen this point is by using `game` to get the overall game's width and height.

```clojure
  :on-touch-down
  (fn [screen entities]
    (cond
      (> (:input-y screen) (* (game :height) (/ 2 3)))
      (println "down")
      (< (:input-y screen) (/ (game :height) 3))
      (println "up")
      (> (:input-x screen) (* (game :width) (/ 2 3)))
      (println "right")
      (< (:input-x screen) (/ (game :width) 3))
      (println "left")))
```

Conveniently, the `:on-touch-down` function also runs when a mouse is clicked on the screen, so we are adding mouse support to the game as well!

## Movement

We already know how to change an entity's position, so let's leverage that to make our image move when we hit the keys. Make a new function above `defscreen` that takes the entity and a keyword, and returns the entity with an updated position:

```clojure
(defn move
  [entity direction]
  (case direction
    :down (assoc entity :y (dec (:y entity)))
    :up (assoc entity :y (inc (:y entity)))
    :right (assoc entity :x (inc (:x entity)))
    :left (assoc entity :x (dec (:x entity)))
    nil))
```

Now we can update our `:on-key-down` and `:on-touch-down` functions to move the entity. Note that we are technically returning a single entity rather than an entities vector, but play-clj will turn it back into a vector automatically.

```clojure
  :on-key-down
  (fn [screen entities]
    (cond
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-down))
      (move (first entities) :down)
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-up))
      (move (first entities) :up)
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-right))
      (move (first entities) :right)
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-left))
      (move (first entities) :left)))
  :on-touch-down
  (fn [screen entities]
    (cond
      (> (:input-y screen) (* (game :height) (/ 2 3)))
      (move (first entities) :down)
      (< (:input-y screen) (/ (game :height) 3))
      (move (first entities) :up)
      (> (:input-x screen) (* (game :width) (/ 2 3)))
      (move (first entities) :right)
      (< (:input-x screen) (/ (game :width) 3))
      (move (first entities) :left)))
```

## Camera

You'll notice that when you resize your game's window, the image looks stretched. That's because the game still thinks it's 800x600 pixels in size, so it stretches accordingly. To make your game adjust its ratio for different screen sizes, you need to use a camera.

First, you need to create a camera and add it to the screen map in the `:on-show` function, like this:

```clojure
    (update! screen :renderer (stage) :camera (orthographic))
````

Orthographic cameras are for 2D games, so that's what we're using. Now, we need to create a new `defscreen` function called `:on-resize`, which will run whenever the screen resizes:

```clojure
  :on-resize
  (fn [screen entities]
    )
```

Lastly, you'll need to make either the width or height of the screen a constant value, so the other dimension can adjust to keep a constant ratio. We'll make the screen's height a constant 600 units in size using the `height!` function, which returns `nil` so the entities vector won't be changed.

```clojure
  :on-resize
  (fn [screen entities]
    (height! screen 600))
```

Now, when you resize your game, the image is no longer stretched!

## Timers

It is often necessary to do something in the future or at regular intervals. For this, we have `add-timer!` and its companion, `remove-timer!`. Let's suppose you want to spawn a new enemy exactly 10 seconds after the game begins. First, add the timer in the beginning of the `:on-show` function:

```clojure
    (add-timer! screen :spawn-enemy 10)
```

Then, add the `:on-timer` function to your screen:

```clojure
  :on-timer
  (fn [screen entities]
    )
```

If you want `:on-timer` to run at a regular 2-second interval, just add that as an argument:

```clojure
    (add-timer! screen :spawn-enemy 10 2)
```

If you want it to run exactly 20 times, you can add one final argument to specify how many times it should repeat after the first run:

```clojure
    (add-timer! screen :spawn-enemy 10 2 19)
```

Of course, you can add more than one timer. The id you supply them will be supplied to the `:on-timer` function's screen map:

```clojure
  :on-timer
  (fn [screen entities]
    (case (:id screen)
      :spawn-enemy (conj entities (create-enemy))
      :spawn-friend (conj entities (create-friend))
      nil))
```

Lastly, at any time you can remove a timer:

```clojure
    (remove-timer! screen :spawn-enemy)
```

## Java Interop

At some point, you will need to do more than simple positioning and sizing. For that, you'll need to call LibGDX methods directly. You could, of course, use Clojure's [Java interop](http://clojure.org/java_interop) syntax on the `:object` contained within the entity. This is a bit ugly, though, and requires you to do all the importing and type hinting yourself.

In play-clj, many different calls, such as `texture`, are actually macros that allow you to call the underlying Java methods after the required argument(s). In this case, the underlying class is called [TextureRegion](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/TextureRegion.html). Consider this:

```clojure
    (texture "clojure.png" :flip true false)
```

...which is transformed into:

```clojure
    (let [entity (texture "clojure.png")]
      (doto ^TextureRegion (:object entity)
        (.flip true false))
      entity)
```

You can even call multiple methods in the same expression this way. For example:

```clojure
    (texture "clojure.png"
             :flip true false
             :set-region 0 0 100 100)
```

...which is transformed into:

```clojure
    (let [entity (texture "clojure.png")]
      (doto ^TextureRegion (:object entity)
        (.flip true false)
        (.setRegion 0 0 100 100)
      entity)
```

There is also an equivalent macro with a `!` on the end, which lets you call these methods on an existing entity:

```clojure
    (texture! entity :flip true false)
```

In this case, you can only include a single method call, because it's also meant to be a simple way to call getter methods that return a value. For example:

```clojure
    (texture! entity :get-region-width)
```

Lastly, there is one final version with a `*` at the end. Essentially, `texture*` is the function version of `texture`. It has the same required arguments, but it can't do any of the Java interop stuff noted above. This is useful because sometimes you may want to pass `texture` around as a function, such as in the first argument of `map`.

If you try that, you'll get the dreaded error: `java.lang.RuntimeException: Can't take value of a macro`. Macros run at compile time, so you can't pass them around like functions. The solution is to use the `*` version, which is indeed a function:

```clojure
    (map texture* ["image1.png" "image2.png" "image3.png"])
```

## Multiple Screens

It is possible to have multiple screens for your game. You may want a title screen at first, and then go to your game when an item is clicked. You can do this by simply calling the same `set-screen!` function that is run in `defgame`. You'll need to pass the game object as the first parameter, so to do that you'll need to declare your symbols at the top of your file:

`(declare hello-world title-screen main-screen)`

Now you are free to call `(set-screen! hello-world main-screen)` inside your `title-screen` if you wish. You may also call it inside `main-screen` itself, which is useful if you want to restart the game!

You may want to display two different screens at once. This is useful in situations where you want to overlay something on your game that you want to remain fixed and independent of the game's camera. For example, to display a label with the current frames per second, create another screen like this:

```clojure
(defscreen text-screen
  :on-show
  (fn [screen entities]
    (update! screen :camera (orthographic) :renderer (stage))
    (assoc (label "0" (color :white))
           :id :fps
           :x 5))
  :on-render
  (fn [screen entities]
    (->> (for [entity entities]
           (case (:id entity)
             :fps (doto entity (label! :set-text (str (game :fps))))
             entity))
         (render! screen)))
  :on-resize
  (fn [screen entities]
    (height! screen 300)))
```

Then, in `defgame`, set the screens in the order in which you'd like them to appear:

```clojure
(defgame hello-world
  :on-create
  (fn [this]
    (set-screen! this main-screen text-screen)))
```

Make sure you add `play-clj.ui` back to your `ns` declaration, so you can use the label again. Also, note that only the first screen, which in this case is `main-screen`, calls `(clear!)` in its `:on-render` function. If `text-screen` called it as well, it would clear whatever was drawn by `main-screen`.

## Using the REPL

It is much faster to develop a game while it's running, and that's what the Clojure REPL lets you do. To get started, just hit the _Run with REPL_ button in the build pane. When it launches, type `(-main)` into the prompt and hit enter, and your game will launch.

Then, switch back to your code while the game is still running. Let's modify `:on-key-down` so the left arrow makes it go right, and vice versa, by swiching the keyword you pass into `move`:

```clojure
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-right))
      (move (first entities) :left)
      (= (:keycode screen) (key-code :dpad-left))
      (move (first entities) :right)
```

Now save the file and hit _Reload_ in the build pane. Now try it out! The key bindings have been changed while the game is still running. Now switch the keywords back and reload again.

Keep in mind that the `:on-show` function only runs when the screen first shows. Therefore, if you want to modify something there and see the result, after you hit _Reload_ you'll need to restart the screen.

First, switch the REPL into the right namespace by typing `(in-ns 'hello-world.core)` and hitting enter. Then, type the following command, which runs the `set-screen!` function on the GL thread in order to restart `main-screen`:

`(on-gl (set-screen! hello-world main-screen))`

The next thing to try is reading and modifying state. Let's peek into the entities vector by typing the following into the REPL:

`(-> main-screen :entities deref)`

That should print out a vector with a single map inside of it. Now try moving your image and then run the command again. The `:x` and `:y` values should now be updated. You're looking at your game in real-time! Lastly, let's try moving the entity from the REPL:

`(-> main-screen :entities (swap! #(vector (assoc (first %) :x 200 :y 200))))`

Lastly, one common issue people have with play-clj in a REPL is that it if you make an error that causes an exception, it's difficult to restart the game after fixing it. To deal with this, there is the `set-screen-wrapper!` function, which lets you catch errors that occur in any screen function and handle them gracefully. For example, here we make it switch to a blank screen if any error occurs:

```clojure
(defscreen blank-screen
  :on-render
  (fn [screen entities]
    (clear!)))

(set-screen-wrapper! (fn [screen screen-fn]
                       (try (screen-fn)
                         (catch Exception e
                           (.printStackTrace e)
                           (set-screen! hello-world blank-screen)))))
```

Note that this will only catch runtime errors, not compile errors such as misspelled symbols (which don't affect your game when they occur). After fixing the issue, you can switch back to `main-screen` from your REPL with `(on-gl (set-screen! hello-world main-screen))`.

## Building for Android

1. Make sure you have JDK 7 installed (for Windows/OSX, you can get it from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html), and for Linux you can get it from [apt-get](http://openjdk.java.net/install/)).
2. Download [the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). However, don't bother getting the "ADT Bundle", which includes a full IDE, because you'll be using Nightcode. Instead, click "Use an Existing IDE" click the button that appears.
3. Extract the file anywhere you want.
4. Run the executable called `android` which is located in the `tools` folder of that archive. This executable will display the SDK Manager with several things checked by default. We want to at least support Ice Cream Sandwich, so check the box next to _Android 4.0.3 (API 15)_ and click _Install_.
5. In Nightcode, click on the `android` folder for your project in the sidebar. You should see a red-colored button called _Android SDK_. Click that, and find the folder you extracted the SDK to.
6. Connect your Android device to your computer and make sure USB debugging is enabled.
7. Click _Run_ and wait for the app to be built and installed on your device.

## Building for iOS

1. Get a computer running OS X.
2. Make sure you have JDK 7 installed (you can get it from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)).
3. Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.
4. Download and extract [the latest RoboVM](http://download.robovm.org/).
5. In Nightcode, click on the `ios` folder for your project in the sidebar. You should see a red-colored button called _RoboVM_. Click that, and find the folder you extracted the SDK to.
6. Click _Run_ and wait for the app to be built and run in the iOS simulator (the _Build_ button will send it to your device, but you need the certificates set up for that and may need to edit `ios/project.clj` to pass the appropriate values to RoboVM).
